version seu3d-1.0.22
fix a bug that percetion is dropped because of the wrong code:
about the bug:
err output is :
[think thread] the perception @ .. is dropped!
in the updatePerception() of WorldModel.cpp, I change the value from
sim_time/2 to sim_time/1000;
but I also find some new bugs, please take care:
the game mode is changing wrongly and some agent goes to game over mode!
I don't know whether it is because this change, please take care of this
change!
If it comes from this change, then:
the server may send error infomation to us, especially the game mode.
After this change, our agents can kick farther than before.

fix the bug that perception is dropped when the hardware is not very good!
about the bug:
err output is :
[Warning] the perception @ .. is dropped!
the method is that:
let the sense thread wait for think thread if the think thread is slower than
sense thread.
the code is for tmp use, I will rewrite it later.
Please downlaod it and test it.
there are still problems or bugs with output:
[think thread] the perception @ .. is dropped!

	- update ChangeLog, NEWS, INSTALL, TODO

2005-12-12  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* implemented parser:
	- the parser can run correctly, 
	- but when parsing some unexpected string, we skip just now
	- it needs more testing!
	
2005-12-11  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* remove all codes which bind with lib of rcssserver3d:
	- and just now for the server change, i decided to give up some codes which bind with lib of rcssserver3d
	- after remove all the codes, i need a new parser
	- and use Singleton instead of zeitgeist structure
	- so, we no need the seu-3d-play.rb, and give up using ruby in our agent

2005-12-04  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* add Joystick function:
	- now, we can use a joystick to control an agent
	- this function are copyed from RoboLog3D, thanks them!

2005-12-01  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* 这些天一直在为AIGame2005作准�
	- 代码已经提交�比赛结果还不知道
	- 这些天的调整已经将能够调整的调整�上层策略采用简单的手工代码
	- 基本能够参加比赛.与以前的代码相比,实力已经大大增强�基本能够战胜清华05全国赛代�
	- 将AIGame2005作为一个milestone,将版本提高到0.2�

2005-11-21  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* fix a bug in commserver!
	- it has been changed in agenttest in rcssserver3d.0.3.go

2005-11-21  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* basic implemented freedom
	* modify BasicWorldModel's small bug: update myself in team
	* advance defence:
	- now, we use 5 Vs 11, results are follows:
	- BrainStrom05 lost 0~2 goals
	- Aria3d05JP lost 2 goals
	- ZJUBase05CZ lost 1 goal
	- WrightEagle2005CZ lost 1 goal
	- it need more work, special in goalkeeper, and def-position

2005-11-20  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* some changes in these days, preparing for AIGame2005:
	- use GA to improve intercept and kickTo
	- implemented clearBall and defendGoal
	- but need more test.

2005-11-10  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* modify intercept:
	- but the effect is nothing!
	- it may reach the geometry algorithm's best
	- so, I will not spend more time on it.
	- I will try other algorithm.
	* implemented calculate ground kick force
	- it use a physic formulation instead of loop in SEU-legend
	- it works well.

2005-11-08  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* modify class Action and ActionDeque
	- add some new functions
	- they are more easlier to ues
	* implemented whenToKick
	- the base version
	- it return Actions,drive or kick or drive&kick

2005-11-07  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* after GA:
	- using GA to adapt var in projectDribbleTo
	- it seems better, but not satistfy me!
	* and do a S function in runTo:
	- makes runTo better
	: today we won the BrainStrom05!(1:0) haha
	: but lose to ZJUBase05 and WrightEagle2005:(
	: some thing need more advance

2005-11-03  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* advance the test enviroment in Trainer:
	- random set the ball and the PL
	- reocrd the how much time the PL use when trying intercept ball

2005-11-02  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* basic implement the test enviroment:
	- it auto run and log
	- but it is only the beginning, it needs more work.

2005-10-30  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* basic implement projectDribbleTo
	- use geometry algorithm:"ZhongChuiXian&QieRuYuan"
	- it begins working, but need more adapt and test.

2005-10-27  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* advanced intercept skill:
	- fixed a bug in changeSpeed
	- new a predictInterceptPos
	+- the palyer's drive is considered
	 - so the results will be more accurater
	 - but, it needs more CPU time

2005-10-25  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* advanced drive skill:
	- these days, I try many ways to control the agent's drive
	- it is lucky that we make improvmance of drive skill
	- and two functions of drive skills are better than the PID algorithm
	- ( perhaps it is not the wrong of PID, it need cut the whole run to dash and brake time,etc )
	- they are runTo and driveTo
	- howerver, runTo is simpler than driveTo
	- and driveTo can get the time of drive
	- so I will continue to test the time, and use it to improve the intercept.
	+ today, we can win Caspain04 :) most 3 goals!
	- so, set version to seu-3d-0.1.11.c7

2005-10-18  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* continue adapt the drive configure:
	- i think the PID paramters can not be changed, it is its best
	- the run position is more accurater
	- but when distacnce is small, and velocity is small
	- this algorithm's drive can not run fast, it takes too long time to accelerate!
	- so, perhaps we need a new algorithm to adapt it.
	* make the predict intercept ball fitter:
	- fix a bug in isFastestOur in WorldModle
	- change the some codes

2005-10-17  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* adapt the drive configure:
	- beaucse PID algorithm is uesed in drive;
	- but the paramters is not satistfied!
	- so, i modify these, and it took me more than 5 hours!
	- it is better now, but i am not sure it is the best.

2005-10-13  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* use NN in predict ball state:
	- isGroundBall isFallOnGround
	- this two use 6 inputs and i outputs, only 1 layer's neural network
	- this two's results is better than the hand codes.
	- but when trying to use NN in isBallStop, and 18 inputs, 2 layers
	- the results is little better than before, so discard this one.

2005-10-09  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* use NN in predict ball state:
	- isGroundBall

2005-10-08  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* import nn-utility tool:
	- this is a neural network tool
	- it can create and use NN easily
	- and just now only a test NN was been created, but not well tested.

2005-10-05  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* these days test many kinds of method -- to make accurater of ball'position and velocity
	- it is better than before,it is just so.:(
	- the results are: ( data in() when dist<5m)
	- the average position error is about 0.1m(0.05m), and average velocity error is about 5m/s(3m/s)
	- and the max position error is less than 0.5m(0.2m), and max velocity error is about 15m/s
	- set version to seu-3d-0.1.10.c6

2005-10-02  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* rewrite the kalmanFilter:
	- move the code kalmanFilter into AgentObject from BasicWorldModel.
	* add some "const"
	
	
2005-10-01  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* complete the localization study:
	- the last method is better than the earyer one
	- the average position error is about 0.05m, and average velocity error is about 0.2m/s
	- and the max position error is less than 0.2m, and max velocity error is about 1m/s
	- so, update the version to seu-3d-0.1.9.c6

2005-09-27  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* fixed a bug in test m-code:
	- beaucse of getVel's bug when time is the same
	* write a newnewlocaliztion:
	- this newnewlocaliztion is different form the newlocaliztion in order
	- the "newnew" first use the vision message to get a weigthed position
	- and then use the drive power to improve the weigthed position.
	- it seems beeter than the "new", the average position error is about 0.05m.
	- but the velocity is still too error:more than 0.5m/s

2005-09-24  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* complete the matlab code for testing localization:
	- make the m-files become one part of this project
	- all uesed m-files contains in ./matlab directory.
	- update the version to seu-3d-0.1.8.c6

2005-09-23  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* complete the first version of new localization:
	- it just can work now
	- but it can be advanced more.

2005-09-22  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* update the version to seu-3d-0.1.8.b6:
	- fixed bugs of send 'R' and recerive 'T'
	+- add set<Time> in Agent, that can record the 'R'-'T' pair.
	 - when 'Rt' is sent, add the 't' to the set<Time>
	 - and when another action want to send 'Rt1', if 't1'='t', the 'Rt1' will not be sent.
	 - thus, make sure not send the same 'R'
	 - when recerive 'Tt', erase the data which '<t',to keep the set<Time> thin.
	- remove some no need codes

2005-09-20  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* modify some files(not code file):
	- modify src/Makefile.am for compiler multiple thread
	- create a bash named converge to collect all the files which needed when run,and tar them.
	- so, set the version to seu-3d-0.1.5.b5
	+ modify converge, make it more smart now.
	- create a bash named compiler to do all compiler work, that it will make a newer work easily.
	- so, set the version to seu-3d-0.1.5.b6
	* add Singleton.h:
	- this is a new template class, it can make sure the object of class is only one
	- for use it, the class public it as a base class
	- and then, you can use MyClass::GetSingleton() freely
	- for advance, you may #define	MYCLASS MyClass::GetSingleton()
	- and now, the Formation and Logger are use this technique.
	+ so, update the version to seu-3d-0.1.6.b6
	* complete the mulitply threads:
	- the two thread can works correctly, but this make the agent need >18MB memory!
	- when not use two thread, the agent only need 8~9MB memory.
	- this makes me trouble: perhaps this area doesn't need mulitply threads.
	- because the action-thread's work is so little. I think if add this work to the main thinking-thread
	- the result will be better.
	+ and now we can compile both mulitply-threads and one-thread agent,just set the Maco.
	- the newest version is seu-3d-0.1.7.b6

2005-09-19  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* create a Class ActionDeque:
	- this class used to set the action which will be send
	- and an action thread will send these actions in correct time
	- what need to do is make sure all parts work correctly and smoothly.

2005-09-18  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* find the way how to compile a multi-thread program:
	- in this project: SEU-3D, we must set the CPPFLAGS=-I...boost
	- to set the boost install directory

2005-09-17  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* import pthread:
	- because of compile problem, it costed me too many hours!
	- and this thread is only print some characters now.
	- but this is the base that we can use mulit-thread technique.

2005-09-05  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* test localization:
	- after emerge,the localization is not good enough now
	- i think the new localization need redesign, not just only sum together.
	* about *const*
	- in C++, const is very usefull, it makes the code stronger.
	- so, in this project must use "const" as more as possible.
	* about *bakup*
	- for damage of harddisk, must upload the newest code to the server

2005-09-03  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* fixed parseC bug:
	- in class commserver: because of *not* GetInPut,
	- so before use GetMsg, GetInPut is needed.
	* begin test new localization code:
	- the new code is OK, so the next step is test with the old code together.

2005-09-02  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* study in localization:
	- try to improve localization
	- start write some new code, but not finished and tested.

2005-09-01  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* modify trainer:
	- the trainer can log all the objects' pos, and the PL open a FileLog: localizationLog, to log myPos
	- these are prepared for debuging localization
	- add some comments in trainer.cpp

2005-08-31  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* modify Makefile.am:
	- can compile in FC2 now.

2005-08-30  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* import UvA's formation:
	- we can use UvA's 433 formation now,and we can import another formation easily.
	* released seu-3d-0.1.5.b3:
	- Aria3d04 1:0		ATH-3D04 0:0
	- Aeolus04 3:0		Aeolus05CZ 0:0		ZJUBase05 0:1
	- yunlu    0:0		DUT_Fantasia 0:1	WrightEagle2005 0:3

2005-08-26  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* modify Player:
	- add the different loops for different PL types
	- just now, every loops are the same: defaultPlayOn
	- modify defaultPlayOn, wander to get a better result.

2005-08-24  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* rewrite class Formation:
	- 3DFormation.h 3DFormation.cpp => Formation.h Formation.cpp
	- can read the formation from the conf file
	- the conf file data formate is the similar to the server message
	- the new class will be easily used and easily add new function

2005-08-22  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* released seu-3d-0.1.4.b3:
	* complete a basic trainer:
	- the trainer can recerive the data from server, and parse it ,record it
	- the trainer can send command to the server, it will make test agent easy
	-- contain set ball's and PL's state, play mode etc.
	- the trainer can load a logfile
	- a base statistic function, can statistic ball position state
	- statistic the some data of the match, and print them after the match or loaded the log file

2005-08-21  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* try to create a Joystick or Keyboard PL:
	- beaucse of not implement the input from the joystick and keybaord, it is not implemented
	- need mroe leaning in linux I/O
	* begin to create Trainer:
	- the trainer can connect to the server now
	- but need more work

2005-08-20  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* improve intercept ball:
	- isFastestOur, projectInterceptPos, gotoWithMinSpeed

2005-08-19  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* study in think time:
	- parse "K" time, send and parse "C" time
	- but both are reply the think time after send done thinking message "D"
	- so the thinking time is the last one, can NOT be used in current thinking.
	
2005-08-18  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* released seu-3d-0.1.3.b3:
	- solve the problem of big binary. the binary become 388K from 3.7M. It was cause by the CXXFLAGS,the -g and -O can not be used at the same time. and the agent needs memory become 6.5M from 7.8M.
	- add seu-3d.rb and agentdb.xml to the distrubtion.
	* released seu-3d-0.1.3.b2:
	- modify configure.ac and Makefile.am
	- modify main.cpp : change the agenttest.rb to seu-3d.rb

2005-08-17  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* continue BasicPlayer:
	- creat its subclass Player
	- new a class named Skill, this class include PL skills
	- the agent can run strategic position and intercept ball now.
	- remove all the no need .h and .cpp files from the project

2005-08-16  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* released seu-3d-0.1.3.b1:
	* complete BasicWorldModel:
	- updateBall is OK now, and the results are as the same as before.
	- updatePlayer is OK now, the results are as the same as before.
	- so the BasicWorldModel is complete:)
	* add new files:
	- Action.h <== SEUSoccerCommand.h
	- Agent.h Agent.cpp Agent_c.h <== behavior.h behavior.cpp behavior_c.cpp soccer.h soccer.cpp soccer_c.cpp
	- BasicPlayer.h BasicPlayer.cpp BasicPlayer_c.cpp <== kicknrun.h kicknrun.cpp kicknrun_c.cpp
	-- class Action and Agent is complete,but not test on line
	-- BasicPlayer need more work.

2005-08-15  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* modify Object:
	- imply function template,so the code lines becomes less
	- add a new subclass of Object: FixedObject, it include flags and goals that can't move.
	* contine BasicWorldModel:
	- update objects' vision, and the deque can works well 
	- localization: complete lowFreqSignalFilter and kalmanFilter, and they can work now,
	- *BUT, i am not sure about which is more better ( the old and the new one )*
	- so, it need more test and modify.
	-- after debug, after set the inital global position after beam, the kalmanFilter calculate the same results as the old SEUWorldModel's kalmanFilter.
	
2005-08-14  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* released SEU-3D-0.1.2.b1:
	- complete all the parsers:
	-- parseOppTeamName(); parseVision(); parseMsgS(); parseMsgT(); parseAgentState();
	-- and now it can parse all the messages( except "C" ) from the server, and it works well.

2005-08-13  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* continue BasicWorldModel:
	- parse current time and the vision time correctly
	- write vision parser, but it can only parse ball correctly just now
	- modify the play mode parser,it can correctly work

2005-08-12  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* added new files: Geometry.h Geometry.cpp Object.h Object.cpp BasicWorldModel.h BasicWorldModel.cpp BasicWorldModel_c.cpp
	- added some geometry functions( sinDeg() i.e.),these functions will make the geometry calulation more easily.
	- added new class: Object -> DynamicObject --> PlayerObject --> AgentObject
						   +-> BallObject
	- these object class can include all objects' information in RoboCup3D simulation
	- *these object class need modify in advance*
	- started writing a new world model,the new world model will contain all the functions of class worldmodel in agenttest and class SEUWorldModel in SEU-legend.
	- for the beginning, write a class named BasicWorldModel first.and the full world model can sub form it.
	- the class BasicWorldModel should do: parse, update, filter...
	- and just now, this is only the beginning, it can parse GameState now.
	

2005-08-10  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* remove the old log system:
	- use the new logger instead the old logger
	- remove SEU3DLog.h SEU3DLog.cpp
	- creat a FileLogger named msgLog, which log the message from server
	* modify main.cpp:

2005-08-09  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* released SEU-3D.0.1.1.b1:
	* write a new log system:
	- the new log system contains two class: Logger and FileLogger
	- Logger is used to trace the agent,it contains two outPuts: stdout and errout
	-- stdout => agent%A-stdout.log  errout => agent%A-errout.log, which are in logfiles/ where server run
	-- stdout can put out in different log-level, this is learned form SEU-2D
	-- I import a new level tree, that can show the log-level easily
	-- Attention! log-level 0 dosen't print level tree, put the log message directly, so log-level 0 can only be used in some suitation.
	- FileLogger is used to record some data,which is needed to adcancedly parse
	-- use FileLogger, we can record data freely, so it can be easily used with other programs(for example Matlab & LogParser)
	-- you can specify the logfile's name, the complete name is logs/logtype-teanmane-num.log
	-- as we know we can't change teamname and num, so we can only specify different logtypes
	-- BUT just now,when agent start,the teamname = '' and num = 0 ,and after serval cycles these are changed, so the FileLogger generate some no need logfiles.I'll find some way to fix it.

2005-08-08  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* modify ./share/lib/zeitgeist/Makefile.am:
	- add more include path
	- AM_CPPFLAGS = ...
	* update Makefile.in by using automake
	- but the distrubtion can't include agentdb.xml:(
	- so, add code into Makefile.in manually
	* remove ./share:
	- remove codes from rcssserver3d
	- but,should specify path of rcssserver3d manually(chang a line in ./src/Makefile.am)
	- Sorry for this inconvenience.
	- for soccer/soccertypes.h add -I/usr/include(also in ./src/Makefile.am)

2005-08-07  Xu Yuan  <xychn15@yahoo.com.cn>
	* released SEU-3D.0.1:
	* creat a new project for SEU-3D
